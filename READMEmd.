So....yeah..........this is somewhat of a mess at this time.

got the basic move cursor working the way I wanted to.
YEA!


ok in the manager folder is
dm.js - Dungeon manager
tm.js turn manager
pm.js - player Character
mm.js - move manager - used only in the player character
monster.js - yup makes the one monster at this moment. Poor, poor, lonely monster.

scenes folder
of course holds the scenes.

TODO in scenes is create sidebar for possible mouse interactions and
so that I can actually see what I need to press to do stuff
like 'm' for move and 'a' for action 'enter' for confirm 'esc' to cancel
If you haven't figure out yet.  Yes those are the key binds at this time.
Oh and 'd' for done with turn.....mainly since you can't attack yet and can only move
making it never go to next turn for other items.


Also want to make that sidebar give info as to what happens......
Yup, that will all go in the scenes folder. along with the title scene, and maybe
the 'you died' scene also.   You never know, I might put that one somewhere else.  Just
to make you wonder why.

Also if for some random reason anyone besides myself is actually reading this....EVER....
