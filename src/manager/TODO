--- TODO ---

look into creating blank layer
!!! make spritesheet from png + my sprites
look back into collision detection for walls and players (monsters to!)



************************************
so how do we change the turn manager?

would like to update and see if we can use the delayedCall() to slow
down the time for it.  Could I use the loop in the turn manager for turn
to loop through the entities and on a player entity create a loop to to wait for
user input?  then dalyedCall with a callback to their personal turn call based 
off of what key is pressed.  or I could implement that in the turnmanager away 
from the update()
-----------------------------------------
removed Update()  went to a timer and custom myUpdate() for calling the Turn 
Manager.   Seems to have fixed the buggy keyDown issues.  Yup found out I didn't
have to use Update() being that I'm not trying to get fps (turn based!)


************************************
createblank layer to use personal sprites on

I will still need to make a personalized spritesheet from the icon on the kenney.nl
sheet and add mine to that.  allowing me to call them since you can only load one 
spritesheet to a map.  unless you use tiled and layers in tiled to load multiple 
spritesheets.


*********************************
fix when monster kills player even though player is dead and gone. Monster keeps 
killing dead player.  Funny but annoying

*****************************
Add the ability to have the monstr find the closest player and go attack them, instead
of always only going after player 1


****************
find way to stop player from moving diagonally through walls, and instead must walk corridor
