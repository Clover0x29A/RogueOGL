--- TODO ---

look into creating blank layer
!!! make spritesheet from png + my sprites
look back into collision detection for walls and players (monsters to!)



************************************
so how do we change the turn manager?

would like to update and see if we can use the delayedCall() to slow
down the time for it.  Could I use the loop in the turn manager for turn
to loop through the entities and on a player entitycreate a loop to to wait for
user input?  then dalyedCall with a callback to their personal turn call based 
off of what key is pressed.  or I could implement that in the turnmanager away 
from the update()


************************************
createblank layer to use personal sprites on

I will still need to make a personalized spritesheet from the icon on the kenney.nl
sheet and add mine to that.  allowing me to call them since you can only load one 
spritesheet to a map.  unless you use tiled and layers in tiled to load multiple 
spritesheets.
